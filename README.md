Banking Application REST API

*In this project, I have built a REST API for a banking application using Spring Boot, Hibernate, and MySQL.

*The banking application follows RESTful principles.

*The API provides services for retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting data from a server by treating data as "resources" accessible through standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, allowing applications to interact with each other and exchange information in a flexible and standardized way.

*The API is designed with proper exception handling and optimized performance to support seamless banking operations.
