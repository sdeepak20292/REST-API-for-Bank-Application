-In this project i have build REST API for banking application using Spring Boot, Hibernate and MySql. 
-The banking application follows Restful principles. 
-The API provides services for retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting data from a server by treating data as "resources" accessible through standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, allowing applications to 
interact with each other and exchange information in a flexible and standardized way
-The API is designed with proper exception handling and  optimized performance to support seamless banking operations.
